# G&T

**Gin and Tonic** (**G&T**) is a classic drink which is easy to make and exists
in tons of variations.

## Ingredients

- Gin
- Tonic
- Lime juice (optional)

## Recipe

The ratio of gin to tonic depends on which gin and tonic that is used.
Personally, I go for 1 unit gin and 2-3 units tonic. I also prefer to add a
splash of lime juice.

For garnish, you can use dried juniper berries.
