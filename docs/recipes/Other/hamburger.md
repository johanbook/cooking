# Hamburger

**Hamburger** is a delicious dish typically praised for being easy to make and
easy to eat. They are perfect for making at an outdoors event.

These are my burger variants.

## Classic Burger

This is my "classic" hamburger recipe which is how I envision a standard burger
should be.

- Buns which are lightly toasted.
- Vegan patty
- Hamburger dressing \*
- Salad
- Slice of tomato
- Pickles
- Pickled onion
- Ketchup
- Mustard
- Sriracha
- Vegan cheese

\* There is a great vegan Hamburger dressing available in Coop in Sweden.

## Stack order

The stack order of a burger is an important - and sometimes religious - aspect
of burgerism. I strongly believe in mayo on bottom bun, salad under patty,
melted cheese on patty and pickles, tomato and onion on top of patty.
