# Hamburger

**Hamburger** is a delicious dish typically praised for being easy to make and
easy to eat. They are perfect for making at an outdoors event.

These are my burger variants.

## Classic Burger

This is my "classic" hamburger recipe which is how I envision a standard burger
should be.

- Salad
