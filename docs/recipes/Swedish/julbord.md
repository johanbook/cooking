# Julbord

**Julbord** is a traditional Swedish meal served on Christmas. In my family we
eat it for lunch and then eat the leftovers for dinner. My julboard consists of

- **Köttbullar**. You can make vegan meat balls using
  [this recipe](./kottbollar-med-brunsas.md) (skipping the sauce).
  Alternatively, many stores sell vegan meat balls.
- **Prinskorv** is a small kind of sausage. It can usually be bought prepared in
  stores.
- **Julsenap** is a sweet and spicy mustard that can be bought in stores.
- **Julskinka** is a baked ham. I have not found a good recipe for this one yet
  :(
- **Sill**. A classical julboard features herring but instead we use tofu. This
  can also be store bought.
- **Potatoes** Cooked potatoes, mashed potatoes or potato gratin.
- **Rödbetssallad** is beetroot. I have not tried any recipes here.
- **Vörtbröd** is a bread baked on Vört and raisins. Should be served with vegan
  butter.

For drinks there should be julmust, Christmas beer and schnaps (ginger shoots
for those who don't drink alcohol).
